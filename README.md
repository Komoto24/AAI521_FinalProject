## Project Description
Black Jack Card Counting with Computer Vision will identify all cards played between the shuffling of a single deck. Then provide a suggestion whether or not to stay or hit your current hand. Finally, it will suggest either a high or low bet on the next hand. Input from the user will be required to indicate a newly shuffled deck is in play. The program will assume heads up play between a single player and the dealer.
